## Getting Started

#### For development:

##### Step 1. start a dev server to serve web pages and enable react fast refreshing;
```
npm run devServer
```
##### Step 2. start another server to enable API data fetching and signaling;
```
npm run express
```

##### Alternative (not recommend, because node console does not use colors, which is less readable, and also, the script behind this command is unstable right now), 
```
npm start
```
